                  <h2>Pay Later</h2>
                  <p>Pay later offers interest-free deferred payments for customers who want to
                    buy with the minimum of fuss and then pay later at their convenience. There’s no
                    need for the consumer to provide lengthy personal details or card numbers to
                    make a purchase. Pay later gives customers full control and trust and can be
                    seen as a ‘get first, pay later’ option which lets customers enjoy the purchase
                    and deal with how to pay at a later stage, confident they won’t have to pay for
                    things they decide not to keep.</p>
